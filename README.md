# arduino-bird-scarer
Code for an Arduino project to scare birds away. It uses several sound files played at random intervals.

This project is just in the prototyping stages right now. I have a working model, but there are several improvements that still need to be made. I am running the sketch on an Arduino Nano compatible microcontroller, using an SD Card and it's shield with a photocell in an old computer speaker. I am using the <a href="http://www.hackerspace-ffm.de/wiki/index.php?title=SimpleSDAudio">SimpleSDAudio library (v1.03)</a> as well.

One more note, it has been almost 15 years since I have written C style code, so my code isn't very pretty. On a positive note, I do write Java code, bash scripts and a handful of other languages nearly everyday, so I do have a good understanding of programming languages.
