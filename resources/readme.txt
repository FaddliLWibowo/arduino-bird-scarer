The files.csv file is organized as follows:

column 1 is the sound file name
column 2 is the day probability of that file being played
column 3 is the night probability of that file being played
column 4 is the duration of the file in seconds
column 5 is the minimum number of times in a row the file should be played
  (this gives short clips a longer duration)
